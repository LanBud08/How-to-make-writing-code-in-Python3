# How-to-make-writing-code-in-Python3
This is a short code showing you how to make python3 say something when you run the module.
You will first need to type the following into your python IDLE,
print("insert text here")
Once you do that, you need to save the file (shortcut: ctrl + s).
You will then choose the file you want to save to, or create a new file for the Python Project.
Once you have saved, you can press run on the python window. (shortcut: F5)
